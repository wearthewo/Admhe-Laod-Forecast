This is a machine learning project with data analysis and egineering of the ADMHE data for short term load forecasting . It is a time series problem.
We use and modify popular machine learning algorithms for time series, vanilla LSTM modeL and the combined CNN-LSTM and CONV-LSTM model. 
Lastly, we summarize comparing the results.
